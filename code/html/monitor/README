node.js sample code to do the following:
01) Open a serial port and log received lines to the console
02) Open a socket.io connection to a browser and push data to the browser every second
03) Combine 01 and 02 - push serial data to the browser

Run the node applications with "node app-01-serial" etc.
Requires socket.io, express 2.x and node-serial packages.
Code probably requires changes to run with express 3.x

For demos 02 and 03, open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

The Arduino code to send A2D readings is arduino-node-demo.ino.
